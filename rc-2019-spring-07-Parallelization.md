## Parallelization

Parallelization can occur at all levels from internal CPU execution of
instructions to programs that are distributed around the world.
Parallelization can be loosely categorized as follows:
 * CPU Instruction and Data parallelization (Computational Intensity)
 * Multi-Core (threading, OpenMP)
 * Multi-Node (MPI)
 * Multi-Problem (batch, Open Science Grid)
