## Course Description
Enable students to utilize advanced computational and data
capabilities for research and industrial practice through 1) proper
project, code, and data management techniques; 2) wide range of
research workflows to solve complex problems; 3) integration of
optimization or other domain specific software tools; and 4) parallel
computing on High Performance Computing clusters.

## Course Objectives
The objective of this course is give students the skills, tools, and
hands-on experience required to effectively utilize advanced
computational and data capabilities for their research.  Topics will
include command line usage, source code revision management systems,
relational and non-relational databases, message and data structures,
web application programmer interfaces, computational engineering
software, scientific and engineering workflows, data management, and
the life-cycle of research projects.  Tools include Git, Python, R,
and Julia with domain specific tools such as CPLEX, Gurobi, and
others.

## Software

A Secure Shell Client (ssh) is required. The following ssh clients are recommended:
 * MobaXterm (https://missouri.app.box.com/rcss-mobaxterm) for Windows,
 * Chrome browser “Secure Shell” extension for Windows, Mac, and
  Chromebooks
  (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo).
