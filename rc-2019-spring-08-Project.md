## Project

The objective of this project is to gain experience with and
demonstrate competency in developing Scientific and Engineering
Workflows and managing data. The project will utilize the methods and
examples covered in the class. Using the "1,2,3, Go" system discussed
in class the data is expected to be "3" (benchmark) and the
computation is expected to be at least "2" (textbook) class.

The project will use the gitlabs `rc-project-$USER-$FIRST-$LAST` git
repository for the project and shared with "Reporter" permission to
the instructor.

### Grading
The project will be graded on the following areas:
1. The utilization of git to manage the project including properly
   formed commits and commit comments.
2. Documentation of the project with a project level
"project/ReadMe.md" file written in "gitlabs flavored markdown" to
describe the files, data, and metadata.  This file should contain the
references to the data used in the project.
3. Documentation of the project data (metadata) placed in the
"project/ReadMe.md" file in a "metadata" section.  If this data is
copied from the website then the URL must be included in the
document.
4. The quality of the data processing and analysis.
5. The quality of the code (formatting, comments, coding style etc.).
6. The use of SLURM to manage the Workflow.
